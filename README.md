The US Births dataset from OpenIntro contains data on births in the United States, including variables such as birth counts, maternal age, and birth month. This analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in birth rates, identify seasonal variations, and examine the impact of factors like maternal age and month on birth outcomes, providing insights for public health strategies and policy decisions regarding maternal and child health.

### Content Migration from Ghost.io to Multiple Platforms (Substack, Patreon, Tumblr)
Date: March 2025

Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: json, os, pandas, BeautifulSoup

Objective: The goal of this project is to help a friend capture and migrate their content from their current Ghost.io website to continue to share on other platforms like Substack, Patreon, and Tumblr. The project will focus on extracting, processing, and formatting the existing content for each new platform while maintaining the integrity of the original material.
#### Scope of Work:
1. Content Extraction from Ghost.io: Extracting all textual content, including blog posts and email-only newsletters, and identify key elements such as titles, metadata, images, and formatting that may need to be preserved or adapted during migration.
2. Data Transformation and Processing: Process the extracted content to ensure compatibility with the features and formatting requirements of Substack, Patreon, and Tumblr.

### Language Detection Tool
Date: February 11 2025

Tools: Python

Libraries: pandas, string, sklearn, kagglehub, pickle, os, streamlit

This project involves building a basic language detection tool using machine learning, starting with data acquisition via kagglehub and initial exploration and manipulation using pandas. Text preprocessing is performed using the string library to clean and prepare the input data. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using sklearn.model_selection. Feature extraction is carried out using TF-IDF vectorization from sklearn.feature_extraction, and the entire process is structured within an efficient sklearn.pipeline. A LogisticRegression model from sklearn.linear_model is trained for classification, with performance evaluated through metrics provided by sklearn.metrics. The final model is serialized using pickle, and the os module is used to confirm successful model saving and loading. The application is deployed via a simple and interactive Streamlit web interface.
This project serves as a foundational exercise in end-to-end development of an NLP-based classifier, including data handling, model training, serialization, and deployment of machine learning applications.

### YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis
Date: February 11 2025 - Present

Tools: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, tqdm, transformers, scipy

This sentiment analysis project leverages YouTube user reviews to extract and analyze public opinion using a combination of traditional NLP techniques and transformer-based models. The workflow involves data preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy, exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and sentiment classification using libraries such as NLTK and Hugging Face’s Transformers. The pipeline includes tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, followed by model fine-tuning and performance evaluation. Progress tracking is integrated with tqdm, and statistical analysis is supported with SciPy to validate findings. This project demonstrates the application of both rule-based and deep learning approaches to natural language processing, offering insights into user sentiment trends and model effectiveness in real-world social media contexts.
