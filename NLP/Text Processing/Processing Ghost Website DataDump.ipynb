      "And sometimes, you need to be there.\n",
      "\n",
      "One good thing is that people generally do these for free or by donating what you can. That means that if you are financially struggling, you can get some aid. However, some diviners do donate readings or work on sliding scales if you really need it so look out for that as an option on their websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another good thing is kinda getting to feel out the diviner's style if you want to sit down for a full reading with them. That said, usually these are pretty quick it can be hard to tell if they are a great fit for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, here's what's one needs to be mindful of when participating in spaces like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a little awkward the first time because you're not sure how to interact and that's ok. You do have to learn how that person likes being interacted with on the fly though.  I have seen a diviner get a little snippy with a readee for displaying less-than-stellar but still not quite rude behavior generated from impatience where others might have just ignored the transgression.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that to say, you need to respect the diviner's time and energy. They're moving quickly and trying to help as many people as they can before it gets too spiritually hot and they must stop for the time being.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that, you need to remember that it's not the time for a full consultation. These are for quick yes/no questions or simple check-ins UNLESS the diviner has said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even if the diviner has okay-ed this, you need to remember that other people are watching and waiting. That means that everyone else is hearing your situation and are in your business. It also means that their energy can affect you. Not the divination but the outcome. Unless you are around particularly bright and spiritually upright people that love cheering people on and seeing others be successful, they're at best apathetic while awaiting their turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something good comes out? You might just have someone who just doesn't feel like anyone else deserves anything at all, let alone anything greater that they feel that they deserve. Something bad comes out? Someone in that space, live, clubhouse, etc might hear your situation and make assumptions that make them against you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This moves us into the next thing. Spiritual hygiene. If you don't have good spiritual hygiene, it will be harder for you to withstand attacks and avoidance is your best measure. Focus on the diviner and what they're saying to you, try to limit contact with people who may not be of good character, are easily influenced and/or have poor spiritual hygiene (the prior two can be symptomatic of poor spiritual hygiene).\n",

      "I remember sitting in the late night with my friend, speaking about another, non-mutual friend and they said simply, \"you have until June.\" I knew that they meant my ancestors were telling them that I had until June to figure out to officially end it. I still asked to confirm, you know, just to be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't want to lose my friend over \"nothing\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Realistically, the beginning of the end of my friendship had long since come. I was struggling under the weight of their problems. I felt personally responsible for them, their life. At times, I was the last thing between that moment and their continued existence here. I wondered sometimes how long it would be until I noticed if something had happened, they always did like leaving for long periods of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, I had just learned the art of no longer struggling under the weight of what others wanted from me. Then I needed to learn not to struggle under the weight of what I knew others needed, but not necessarily from me. I needed to learn that I cannot want more for anyone else than they want for themselves at the expense of my own mental and physical well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was setting myself on fire to keep them warm, when warm would not last if I ceased to exist. I was sacrificing myself as a temporary balm when what they need was so much more than any one person could provide.\n",

I'll just be the emotional support person.\" Oh, Lemon, don't you ever just listen to yourself? Does it even count as a joke if it's more truth than humor?\n",

      "Nonetheless, I learned. We can psychoanalyze my jokes later.\n",

      "\n",

      "In that, I learned a lot about personal warning signs, but also a lot about self-trust and self-worth.\n",
      "\n",
      "In self-trust, I allowed external factors to dictate whether or not I would 'pass' certain behaviors even though I knew I was not okay with them. They were unwell, just like I was... it's ok, right? They didn't really have to gaslight me, I did the bulk of the work for them. Eventually, I had to put my foot down and remind myself that the \"outsider opinion\" is ultimately meaningless to my lived experience. No, it was unacceptable and, yes, I mean it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was my first step towards self-worth. As soon as I started trusting my experience of the world and not bending to other perspectives, things fell into place. It was a lot easier to see the things I needed to, even if I couldn't explain it. I wasn't supported in the ways that I needed and was always playing captain-support-a-hoe. I, myself, was not ok and my friend had been worsening it for a while.  I was worn out from all of it. I had two options. Save me or them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose me, just as my ancestors directed me to so many moons ago. I left the weird mentally and emotionally abusive friendship. I saved me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided then that I would never choose someone who did not treat me well, one who I never felt safe with. Or if I did, I was packing it up and removing myself as soon as possible. I will not settle for less. I know there's more than this and I DO deserve better.\n",

      " 1. The name is modified in some manner. Usually it's an additional character or two. This isn't exhaustive but here are the ones I see most often.\n",

      " 2. Post history is weird\n",
      "    \n",
      "    * Upload history is all on a single day\n",
      "    * Posts are missing from the actual practitioner's post history\n",

      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. Follower counts are an okay marker but people CAN and DO buy followers so that's not the most reliable (e.g. one very popular conjurer commented with amusement that the scam page had more followers than she herself did).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. Real practitioners do not DM you to offer services if you didn't ask first. A DM from a popular page is a red flag to begin with.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    They will not just start being overly familiar with \"dear\" or \"sweetie\" or \"love\", etc. Nor will they just send prayers out of the goodness of their hearts for people they have never once spoken to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll be sure to update this page with more observations when I notice some but for now, that's it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have an account reach out to you, then search for an account similar to that name and see who's following the other one. Are there other popular people within that community? Is there any evidence of interaction beyond what they've built themselves to be (that is, some do give live readings, others only give readings by appointment on their website, etc)?\n",
      "\n",
      "You must practice serious scrutiny in order to avoid being taken advantage of. The social media powers that be (namely Instagram and Twitter) have decided that they are not going to help and will go as far as to remove the correct account instead of the impersonator account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to provide an observation that I've made about scamming in general. These scammers often rely on a lack of knowledge, gullibility, and desperation. However, that's not all there is to these spiritual spaces. These aren't the traditional \"oh, Microsoft is calling about my anti-virus\" or whatever. It's still impersonation. But it's more awful and insidious than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? Because it weaponizes the respect you have for the person being impersonated, as well as the powerful, very human motivator that I like to call \"être vu\". It literally means \"to be seen\".\n",
      "\n",
      "People come to spirituality in desperate states, and often have the particular desire to be seen... so much so that the first person to notice them loses natural inspection. People want to believe that this grand, important, admirable person saw them as valuable enough to be helped. To not be so alone in this great, big, overwhelming world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scammers take advantage of this basic human desire and make off with people's money because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know this sounds rather harsh but the truth is that, as unique as you are, everyone else is also one-of-a-kind. Most of these practitioners are by all accounts extremely busy, working people. Do you think they have time to DM you? Hold a conversation at all hours of the day and night? They don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "They genuinely don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of them are busy raising kids, with a whole spouse, their own physical and mental well-being to look after, their spirits to work for their benefit... they are busy with their own lives. Spiritualists have lives to attend to.\n",
      "\n",

      "It provided more purpose to their life in some ways. They chose. They did. It was more meaningful to have made that decision, to have exercised control, for themselves - even if they couldn't remember making the decision. It was a form of self-empowerment.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Yet another aside: broadly, ATRs also hold that passing through the womb is to pass through the waters of forgetfulness and that one is tasked with finding and effectuating their destinies here on earth. Exact details will vary.]\n",

      "One: circumstances requiring radical change.\n",

      "An event happened that affected you enough to either want to accept or deny, embrace or avoid. That's just a comment on human nature that leads to the next point.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Two: committing to a decision about that circumstance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lasting change is dedication and persistence, meaning you very likely had a reason or goal in mind when you made the decision. And let me be clear, it doesn't have to be a good reason, goal, decision or even overall positive transformation. It could be silly and ultimately pointless. But it was still driven by something. And perhaps turns out to be a pointless or futile pursuit.\n",

They trade goods among themselves so they could have more variety and helped out with the weeding, cleaning, sowing and collecting dried seeds or watering for a while, without disruption. The consultation with the Ifá priest warning them to not forget Èṣù was long forgotten.\n",

The other goes, \"I saw him but that was definitely a red hat, what are you blind?\"\n",

Their crops were gone. No crops means no food for the family and it definitely means no extras to sell at the market as they have been doing all these years for extra profit and variety.\n",

Then there's the element of futility - be serious, was the argument over such a petty detail as the color of a hat on a stranger a long distance away worth the dissolution of an otherwise excellent friendship/partnership and the support they provided to each other?\n",

From their position, the hat was indeed one of those colors. It would have only taken another person to see Èṣù's front or back to correct, if not prevent, the argument all together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because reality is comprised of various angles, it's probably best to assume that any single individual does not have all around sight of the issue at hand. This doesn't mean go take Larry, Jim, Joe, James' and Bob's opinion just because they said it. After all, not everyone who can speak uses their mouth correctly and not everyone who has a brain uses it thoughtfully. But would it have hurt them to at least be open to hearing the potential of another option and seeing if they could reconcile between what information is currently held and that which is not?\n",

      "\n",
      "I think what he was addressing was their misconceived perception of themselves. Èṣù is an expert in this field, he already knew that it couldn't just be said. The priest already told that they needed a little extra help staying together. Èṣù simply showed them exactly what was seen by Ifá in a wholly undeniable way. They would be forced to confront where they, as people, lacked in ability to either talk it out or let it go, something the best of friends should have been able to do easily.\n",

      "\n",
      "Some quickly gathered associated words: passive, thoughtful, soft, graceful, intuitive, patient, nurturing, accepting, vulnerable.\n",

      "\n",

However, I regard these things as part of being a human being with feeling. In that I mean that I have the capacity to be all of these things, of course I do because everyone does. It doesn't mean that I show them all the time or evenly but they get shown where I feel appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't tend to be very passive. I'm still working on being vulnerable with other people. I guess I have soft skin physically but emotional softness is generally reserved for children. Patience? Tah! The idea of having children is one I have struggled with, not because of my apparent issue with my experience of womanhood, but because I don't think of myself as a very nurturing person. Children need nurturers and I don't think I can be that for extended periods of time as children so often need. And with the impatience? That's a disaster waiting to happen and why should any child be subjected to that?\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I was told to learn to balance the masculine and feminine within me. I was also given the additional instructions that usually come with it. This one was no pants. For a full week, only dresses or skirts.\n",
      "\n",
      "This presented it's own issue. I needed to go shopping because I didn't have any work appropriate dresses. I do now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's where it loops back around. I struggle with traditionally feminine things. I was very pretty... and agitated! but pretty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? Why do it if I was just so uncomfortable in my body? Why do it if the attitude towards it was going to be so negative and I knew that it was? Simple. Ifa said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I really have to show for it is a resounding “uh, what the fuck, why?” and guilt about not feeling into it nor exactly understanding why I have to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if you're not aware. I'm an African American. I grew up in the southern United States where I attended church in little tutu dresses. I am very vehemently anti-tulle. It sucks, I'm itchy and only itchy. All I can be is itchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tulle is not a safe space.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point of me saying that is that my lived experience is that of a little black girl tortured by dresses who grew into a black woman with a blended cultural and religious understanding of Africanisms and western ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that in mind, I presume that my concept of womanhood is different from that of an indigenous African woman. I'm sure there's some extra meaning to the need for a dress based in some cultural norm reflected in the odu. I don't have that cultural knowledge so this connection can only be made via what I do have.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the States, dresses are valued as a form of femininity but it's not strictly required to be regarded as feminine or womanly. I might be willing to argue that it's still peak femininity but these days, it's not the only way to express that. I'm in the “other” category here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, it's obvious that not only does this not actually fix my problem but it feels distinctly performative.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt pretty and as an adult, I can choose what I wear so I chose silkier, uncomplicated dresses to make it easier on me. I did find things I liked but weren't me per se, but in part because I don't find dresses to be “me”.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt like I was just playing pretend for a few days, like I snuck into my mom's closet or something (which, by the way, I did not do that as a child). I even wore heels once because it went with it and I was like “well the point is to look like a woman right?”\n",
      "\n",
      "In my day to day life, I generally choose what makes me feel comfortable in my body. That's just not often a dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I like being dolled up from time to time? Yes. Do I think it's a lot of work for like five people and myself to see me? Also yes. It's a lot of work to be presentable as a feminine person and for me to be bothered, it needs to count for something. There must be a reason for me to be in a dress, be it “please wear x for y occasion’, or ‘Ifa said this would help’ or “ah these pants are not passing the vibe check for a quick trip to the grocery for sweet tea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, I don't have all of the pieces on why those energies are out of balance. Ifa’s take on this wasn't provided either. If Ifa’s point was to yank out all of the random childhood memories of being ignored about being uncomfortable in the stupid fluffy dresses or how I hate shaving and how that represents yet another insecurity about being a femme person for me... well congrats. Maybe the point was to confront those things. I don't know, Ifa didn't exactly say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I model a lot of the qualities of the women I looked up to in my family. I take pride in feeding people well. I take pride in a well-kept home. I take pride in a clean appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are women that have always prioritized doing what needs to be done. They're not really “wait for others” types. Not only is this behavior familiar to me but I don't care much for dependency. It's a childhood insecurity I'm working my way out of but it also means I don't prefer needing anyone else. If we're to keep a buck fitty, I have a hard time needing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not get the vibe that this is all there is to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did I figure any of that extra shit out with Isese? No. Isese wasn't even the first to tell me that shit was out of balance. I was just slowly working my way through what I had space for between all the other things coming up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to mention, that imbalance is also interpreted as \"You need a man\" and there's a hormone imbalance. Do I believe it? Eh for one, but I have other supporting proof about two because, surprise surprise, I live with my vagina. It does not tell me jackshit about the imbalance. Getting dicked down is supremely unlikely to change shit but also, Ifa this man you been talking about for the last year... where because I'm not going out and about in the rona times, I do know that.\n",
