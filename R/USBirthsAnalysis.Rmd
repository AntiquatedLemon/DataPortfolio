This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

categoricals: mature, premie, lowbirthweight, sex, habit, marital, whitemom interval: weeks ratio: fage, mage, visits, gained, weight,

is it possible to remove all rows with NAs and if so, by how much does that reduce my dataset fun little side project could be augmentation of the dataset through R

-   to either fill the NA gaps (some process of interpolation, extrapolation)

-   double or even triple the dataset by some specific type of sampling (e.g. stratifying that can balance the observations a bit)

```{r}
sum(is.na(births))
var()
sd()
```

```{r}
boxplot(age ~ gender, data = donors)
```

```{r}
hist(donors$totalGivingAmount,
  xlab = "Total $ Given",
  main = "Right skewed histogram"
)

stripchart(donors1_20$age, # identify my variable of interest
  method = "stack",        # stack identical giving amounts
  xlab = "Age",            # label the x-axis
  ylim = c(0, 10),         # put the dots closer to the axis
  pch = 16,                # use dots for each donor
  cex = 2                  # make the dots a smaller size
)

barplot(table(donors$urbanicity),
  las = 1,                          # Rotate the numbers of the y-axis
  ylab = "Count",                   # Label the y-axis
  cex.axis = 0.75,                  # Make the numbers of y-axis smaller font

  col = c(rep("gray", 4), "red")    # color the first four gray; the last red
